**AIM:**
The primary goal of developing personal assistant software (a virtual
assistant) is to employ semantic data sources available on the web,
user contributed content, and knowledge databases to provide
information. To activate the listener, voice-based intelligent assistants
require an invoking phrase or wake word, followed by the order. Virtual
assistants may save you a lot of time. One of the primary benefits of
voice searches is their speed. In fact, voice searches are said to be four
times faster than written searches.


**ABSTRACT:**
A voice assistant software can understand spoken language and
respond with synthetic voices. Users can use voice commands to
manage basic chores like email, to-do lists, and calendars, as well as
ask inquiries, operate home automation devices, and media playback.
Our software will be designed such that it prioritises privacy over all
else.
